# ParadoxiBox

A Music Player on a Server with web controller

- Tested on a Raspberry Pi 3B+ (need to install rust [rustup install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for one python dependcy)

Work In Progress

Available now:
- Show downloaded musics
- Download new music (thanks to [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp))
- Play one music in the server
- Play a queue in the server
- Pause/Resume the music
- Skip a song
- Automatically play a new song if option turned on (thanks to [ytmusicapi](https://ytmusicapi.readthedocs.io))

TODO:
- Better way to add song to the queue (throuht a search autocomplete for already downloaded songs and download it otherwise) [i.e.: not 2 distinct pages]

# USAGE
